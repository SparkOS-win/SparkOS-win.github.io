Every mod can and will have bugs. And SparkOS is no exception. On this page, you will find the current bugs in SparkOS.

<h1>Critical bugs</h1>
The first bug is that elements like the start menu will be broken without graphics drivers. Until I find a way to force the mod into accepting transparency effects with no drivers, this will remain as a bug. Also make sure you reboot after installing the drivers so that the customizations fix themselves.

No more for now!
